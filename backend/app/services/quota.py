"""Per-organization quota enforcement.

Two parallel quotas are tracked: leads collected this month, and AI/LLM
spend this month (kopecks ₽×100). Both reset on the 1st via celery beat.

The AI cap exists because every search now hits an LLM (prompt enhancer +
candidate filter), so a single noisy team can otherwise drain the shared
YandexGPT / GigaChat / Anthropic credit pool. The cap is denominated in
kopecks so we can do all accounting in plain ints without float drift.
